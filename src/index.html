            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This is a group for anyone, of any skill level and background,
                interested in the development, engineering, and craft of building
                and designing software. Topics may include code katas, SOLID design
                discussions, TDD, agile development, various programming languages
                and frameworks, code retreat events, volunteer work, mentoring,
                and anything the group is interested in as we move forward. If you
                have a topic that you'd like to present (be that for 15 minutes,
                an hour, or whatever you need) let us know and we'll set it up! The
                skills and interests of our regular members range from .NET,
                Android, and front-end design, to embedded programming, Azure, game
                development, Ruby and clean code. We welcome everyone!</p>
            <p>I started this group to meet other people interested in software
                development in the valley, to learn and grow, and to provide a
                place for beginners to come to get started in programming and
                software engineering. By building up the community we'll each be
                able to improve and help others grow along the way. I'm looking
                forward to meeting more Software Crafters in the area!</p>
            <p>Software Crafters are people who write software and care about
                self-improvement, quality, continuous learning and helping one
                another. These people come from a variety of backgrounds and
                experiences. Together we can help each other learn and grow.
                Companies like 8th Light promote this type of mentality and use the
                "Software Crafter" job title which is why I chose the name
                "Kalispell Software Crafters".</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or concerns feel
                free to message me (Travis) or any of the other organizers
                (Skyler and Sam) anytime!</p>
            <p>Kalispell Software Crafters is dedicated to a harassment-free
                experience for everyone. Be that at an event or within our
                Slack/Discord community. Please review our anti-harassment
                <a href="https://github.com/kalispell-software-crafters/code-of-conduct">policy</a></p>
