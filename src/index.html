				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>
					This is a group for anyone, of any skill level and
					background, interested in the development, engineering, and
					craft of building and designing software. Topics may include
					code katas, SOLID design discussions, TDD, agile
					development, various programming languages and frameworks,
					code retreat events, volunteer work, mentoring, and anything
					the group is interested in as we move forward. If you have a
					topic that you'd like to present (be that for 15 minutes, an
					hour, or whatever you need) let us know and we'll set it up!
					The skills and interests of our regular members range from
					.NET, Android, and front-end design, to embedded
					programming, Azure, game development, Ruby and clean code.
					We welcome everyone!
				</p>
				<p>
					I started this group to meet other people interested in
					software development in the valley, to learn and grow, and
					to provide a place for beginners to come to get started in
					programming and software engineering. By building up the
					community we'll each be able to improve and help others grow
					along the way. I'm looking forward to meeting more Software
					Crafters in the area!
				</p>
				<p>
					Software Crafters are people who write software and care
					about self-improvement, quality, continuous learning and
					helping one another. These people come from a variety of
					backgrounds and experiences. Together we can help each other
					learn and grow. Companies like 8th Light promote this type
					of mentality and use the "Software Crafter" job title which
					is why I chose the name "Kalispell Software Crafters".
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or concerns
					feel free to message me (Travis) or Skyler anytime!
				</p>
				<p>
					Kalispell Software Crafters is dedicated to a
					harassment-free experience for everyone. Be that at an event
					or within our Slack/Discord community. Please review our
					anti-harassment
